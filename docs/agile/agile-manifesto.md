# Manifesto for Agile Software Development

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
