# Scrum Resume

## Scrum Events

### Product Backlog

_Product Backlog_ is an ordered list by priority of items of requirements that the product must have (features, fixes, changes, improvements, etc). Items inside the _Product Backlog_ are called _Product Backlog Items_. An item contains all that is needed to understand the requirements (description, estimation, acceptance criteria, etc). Note: Scrum don't force the usage of any tools to manage a backlog or form for the _Product Backlog Items_.

## Scrum Events

### Sprint

- **Objective:** Having regular feedbacks on each iteration and make improvement on the product faster. Enable predictability.
- **Duration:** one-month or less
- **Input:** Scrum Events, Team scrum work
- **Output:** A done increment


> Each Sprint may be considered a short project

A scrum project is splited in sprints.

A Sprint is a repeatable fixed time-box during when all the things needed to develop a product (requirement, analyse, design, develoment and testing) are done. At the end of a sprint a shippable product increment is created and the Scrum team demonstrate the shippable product increment to stackholders and product owner. By mo means a release of the SPI is mandatory at the end of the sprint. It must be shippable but not necessarily shipped.

It allows to have regular feedbacks on each iteration and make improvement on the product faster. So that we have more chances to build the right product.

Sprints contain the Sprint Planning, daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

### Sprint Planning

- **Objective:** Organize the sprint and define what can be delivered before it starts
- **Attendees:** The _Scrum Team_
- **When:** At the very beginning of the sprint
- **Where:** unspecified by the scrum guide

  - The _Developers_ plans the work necessary to deliver
  - _Product Owner_ and _Developers_ negociate the content of the sprint

> Describe the goal of the sprint and how they to start working

### Daily Scrum

  - Feedback from the stakeholders regarding the increments
  - Potential update on the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace

    - Demonstrates the work that it has "Done"
    - Answers questions about the increment

### Sprint Retrospective


- **Objective:** Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools. Identify what went well, what could be improve and make a plan to achieve it

## Final say

And that's it for a basic understanding of Scrum and its concept. As scrum is often mixed with other agile principles like users story or poker planning, it can be confusing to differential what is part of scrum and what is not.
