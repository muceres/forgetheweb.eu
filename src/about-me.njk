                <p style="margin-top: 0px;">I'm a French Back-End Software Engineer remotely working at <a class="explicit-link blue" href="https://www.epitech.eu/en/">Trusk</a>
                 and  I graduated from <a class="explicit-link blue" href="https://www.epitech.eu/en/">Epitech - European Institute of Information Technology</a>. I occasionally do Freelance.
                 I was born and raised in Paris but I recently moved in Novi Sad, Serbia.
                </p>
                <p>I'm fond of Javascript/Node JS. I sometimes also use Python. In general, I prefer minimalist approaches rather than over-engineered solutions. In my work, I give a lot of importance to practices like functional programming, jamstack,
                  unit tests, documentation and open source.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">When away from the computer, I enjoy traveling, hiking, martial arts, swimming, cooking, continuous learning and reading.</p>
